### 2. What was most eye opening about the first class and how has it changed your perspective on teaching?

Knowing the different kinds of teaching and the strategies that can be used to achieve true learning was a great finding for me. Also, knowing that none of these methods is better than the others but that those can complement each other was also great to learn. I used to think that, as an instructor, you would have kind of a silver bullet strategy for everything, but now knowing that I can use different techniques depending on the audience, the content and the context in general is really powerful.
